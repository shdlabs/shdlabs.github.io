<h1>hello</h1>

<p>I need help embedding a markdown, or *.md, file inside of an HTML index file. I have found that I can embed HTML
	inside of markdown, but not vice-versa. This would help to increase the speed of my editing because markdown format is
	extremely easy to use, (as I&#8217;m using it now) and I don&#8217;t have to change the format of the rest of my site.
	I know that</p>
